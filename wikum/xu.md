# x첫 - a mscgen super set
_**It is mscgen, but not as we know it**_

## Inline expressions
[SDL][2] has a feature called _inline expressions_. They allow you to group a bunch of 
arcs and label them somehow. To define a loop, for instance. Or a conditional statement. 

[UML2][3] sequence diagrams have a similar concept called "combined fragments" (see 
paragraph 14.3.3 of the linked document for details). 

Behaviour specification is not a particularly strong suit of interaction diagrams
(sequence charts/ diagrams/ collaboration diagrams), as Martin Fowler
correctly notes in [UML distilled][1]. At this time (December 2013) mscgen does not 
support them. 

Nonetheless inline expressions are damn handy. Hence x첫, a superset of mscgen
including them. 

## An example
This is an example of a x첫 script describing an interaction that loops over
a list of changes and sorts the old ones to a deletion queue, and the
rest to a birth queue:

```mscgen
msc {
  a, b [label="change store"], c,
  d [label="necro queue"], e [label="natalis queue"], f;

  a =>> b [label="get change list()"];
  a alt f {
    b >> a [label="list of changes"];
    a =>> c [label="cull old stuff (list of changes)"];
    b loop e {
      c =>> b [label="get change()"];
      b >> c [label="change"];
      c alt e {
        c =>> d [label="queue(change)"];
        --- [label="change newer than latest run"];
        c =>> e [label="queue(change)"];
        --- [label="all other cases"];
        ||| [label="leave well alone"];
      } [label="change too old"];
    } [label="for each change"];
    c >> a [label="done processing"];
    --- [label="nothing found"];
    b >> a [label="nothing"];
    a note a [label="silent exit"];
  } [label="changes found"];
}
```
