To make this as easy as possible for you, here's some simple guidelines:

### General

  from the [contributor covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/).

### Reporting issues

  - These include bug reports, questions, feature requests and enhancement
    proposals
  - [GitHub's issue tracker](https://github.com/sverweij/mscgen_js/issues)

    - Mocha tests prove your code does what it intends.
    - Your code does not introduce regressions - ```make check``` proves this.

      how variables & parameters are named) fits in with the current code base.
