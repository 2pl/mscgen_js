So you want to contribute to mscgen_js? Cool!

To make sure your contribution gets into the code base with the minimum of fuss,
it has to adhere to some simple rules before being considered for acceptance into
the code base:

*Code contributions* 
- We prefer well documented [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
- plan to do something drastic? Contact me first (twitter: @SanderSpeaks, or leave an issue on github)

*Code quality*
- Additions pass jshint.
- Mocha tests prove your code does what it intends. 
- Your code does not introduce regressions - ```make check``` proves this
- code style (you know, petty things like indentations, where brackets go, how variables &
  parameters are named) 

*Legal*
- the code you add will be subject to GPLv3, just like the rest of mscgen_js
- the code you add is your own original work
