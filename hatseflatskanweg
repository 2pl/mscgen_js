Could not make a booking through EBT. Made one directly in Amadeus (ZVMWXX/vanschothuijzen) - works as expected

# Business_Process_MT_Select ABA
## -Question- Rebate should only get ABA offer
Walked through the scenario (ZVNMLG/SIMPSON). ABA is offered, but SPS (/ PS/ AAAS) is not returning prices and 
B.t.w. if rebate means staff travel: staff travelers don't get an ABA offer (but they have a generous base allowance in stead)
