# interactive interpreter
:page_with_curl: code in [../mscgen-interpreter.js](../mscgen-interpreter.js) and
the sources in [ui-control/](.).

## Rendering in real time
When we built the first version of the on line interpreter we parsed and
rendered the chart at each key-up. It turned out the javascript
was more than fast enough to keep up, so we kept this approach.

In our enthusiasm we also started pre-rendering the raster graphics
versions, but that turned out to be too slow (data below), so
these are now generated when you actually click the button.

Our findings from that experiment:
> - rendering base64 encoded strings on each keystroke is too slow:
  - canvg is called twice for doing exactly the same (svg => canvas)
  - it inserts relatively big amounts of data in the DOM tree
    (typically 20k for svg, 60k for png, somewhat more for jpeg,
    not even corrected for the base64 penalty)
  - for bigger sources (e.g. test01_all_possible_arcs.mscin)
     auto rendering is unbearably slow, which stands to reason as
     the source tree has to be updated with  
     1.3 * (~250k (png) + ~250k (jpeg) + ~80k (svg)) = ~750k
     on each keystroke  
     How slow? 4-5 seconds for each keystroke for test01
     on a 2.53 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo running OS X 10.8.4 in
     FF 23/ Safari 6.0.5
  -  Only generating the svg to base64 encoding is doable in regular
     cases, but is noticeable in test01.

## Raster graphics - png and jpeg
For rendering raster graphics we use the `canvg` library, which takes
a piece of svg and renders it on a canvas. When that has happened, a
call to the canvas's `toDataURL` function suffices to return the base64
encoded version of the chart.
