                        Mscgen_js is created to follow the mscgen standard, not the other way 'round.
                        Mscgen was created by and is maintained by
                        <a href="http://www.mcternan.me.uk/mscgen/index.html">Mike McTernan</a>, not by me.

                                Log an <a href="https://github.com/sverweij/mscgen_js">issue</a> in
                                the github repository. You'll need an account on github to do that, however
                                and you might not have one. So you can also try to ...
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                ... contact me directly. I'm on <a href="https://twitter.com/SanderSpeaks">twitter</a>

                                Lastly, if you're handy with javascript: create a fork of the
                                <a href="https://github.com/sverweij/mscgen_js">source</a> on
                                github, fix it and create a pull request. Be sure to understand that - if
                                I decide to merge it to master - your contribution will be licensed under

                    <p>
                        I'm sorry. That shouldn't have happened. However, I'm happy you're taking
                        the time to tell me. <a href="#improve-mscgen_js">yadda</a>

                    <h3>I want to send you money</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you have a spontaneous urge to send me money: don't. I'm not doing this
                        for the money.
